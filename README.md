# RNP Chat Protocol

This repository contains the implementation of the **RNP Chat Protocol**, developed as part of a group project for the Computer Networks (Rechnernetze) module at HAW Hamburg. The project was carried out by a team of more than 10 students.

## Project Overview

The RNP Chat Protocol is a custom messaging protocol implemented over _TCP_ and an _overlay network_. It allows sending and receiving messages efficiently and reliably within a decentralized network structure.

Key features include:

- Reliable message delivery and forwarding using TCP.
- Communication via an overlay network for scalable peer-to-peer connections.
- Group collaboration design, simulating real-world network protocol development.
